# Weather-Classification-using-Machine-Learning
Designed a weather classification model using Machine Learning Concepts

Dataset used - kaggle datasets download -d vijaygiitk/multiclass-weather-dataset
The dataset features 5 different classes of weather collected from the above said different sources, however it's real life data so any system for weather classification must be able to handle this sort of images. 
The dataset contains about 1500 labelled images including the validation images. Images are not of fixed dimensions and the photos are of different sizes. 
Each image has only one weather category and are saved in separate folder as of the labelled class.
Each image have been rated for the weather condition on a scale of 0 to 4:

0 - Cloudy
1 - foggy
2 - rainy
3 - Shine
4 - Sunrise.
